## Usage

To start uploading images, you need to create an account.
You can do this by:

1. Logging in with Google (preferred)
2. Creating a unique username and password

Once logged in, head to the `/Upload` page to upload your images:

1. Select an existing collection from the "Trip Select" dropdown or create a new one
2. Choose a location on the map where the event took place
3. Upload your images
4. Visualize them on the map

Once uploaded, you can view your images in two ways:

- On the **timeline** on the right-hand side
- As **data cards** on the map

Click on either to view the images within that collection.
